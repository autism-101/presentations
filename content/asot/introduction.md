## Why Are We Talking About This Now?

- The "Graying" of the population globally.
- The first generation diagnosed as children are now entering middle age.
- The massive, previously unidentified cohort of people aged 50-80+.
- A critical lack of research and services for autistic seniors.

    <aside class="notes">
        Mention here that gerontology and neurodivergence research have historically been siloed. We are just now building the bridge.

## The Timeline of Invisibility

Why didn't they get diagnosed 40 years ago?

---

- 1943-1944: Kanner & Asperger define the condition (mostly in children).
- 1980 (DSM-III): "Infantile Autism" enters the DSM. Strict criteria.
- 1994 (DSM-IV): Asperger's Syndrome added. The beginning of broader recognition.
- 2013 (DSM-5): ASD becomes a spectrum; allows for adult diagnosis more easily.

        <li><strong>The "Lost Generation":</strong> Those diagnosed late in life, or still undiagnosed.</li>
