## Why Are We Talking About This Now?

- The "Graying" of the population globally.<sup><a href="#/26">[2]</a></sup>

- The first generation diagnosed as children are now entering middle age.<sup><a href="#/26">[3]</a></sup>
- The massive, previously unidentified group of people aged 50-80+.<sup><a href="#/26">[4]</a></sup>
- A critical lack of research and services for autistic seniors.<sup><a href="#/26">[5]</a></sup>

    <aside class="notes">
        Mention here that gerontology and neurodivergence research have historically been siloed. We are just now building the bridge.

- <strong>1943-1944:</strong> Kanner & Asperger define the condition (mostly in children).
- <strong>1980 (DSM-III):</strong> "Infantile Autism" enters the DSM. Strict criteria.
- <strong>1994 (DSM-IV):</strong> Asperger's Syndrome added. The beginning of broader recognition.
- <strong>2013 (DSM-5):</strong> ASD becomes a spectrum; allows for adult diagnosis more easily.

<ul>
<li><strong>Diagnosed early:</strong> now aging.</li>
<li><strong>"Lost Generation":</strong> diagnosed late in life, or still undiagnosed.</li>
</ul>
