    <h2>Supporting Older Autistic Adults</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Believe them:</strong> If they say they are autistic late in life, validate it. Do not demand a difficult-to-obtain formal diagnosis to provide support.</li>
        <li><strong>Sensory Audits:</strong> Evaluate living spaces for sensory triggers (lighting, humming noises, textures).</li>
        <li><strong>Clear Communication:</strong> In healthcare and legal planning, use literal, clear language. Allow extra processing time.</li>
        <li><strong>Redefining "Social":</strong> Respect the need for solitude. Connection doesn't have to mean group activities in a noisy senior center.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Moving Forward: Unmasking</h2>
        <p>Unmasking is crucial for healthy aging.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Preserving energy by stopping the performance of "neurotypicality."</li>
            <li>Allowing stimming and sensory aids (headphones, sunglasses) without shame.</li>
            <li>Connecting with the autistic community (often online) to share lived experiences.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>The Future of Aging</h2>
    <p>We need a paradigm shift in geriatric care.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Neurodiversity-affirming training for geriatricians and care home staff.</li>
        <li>More research focused on the quality of life for the 60+ autistic population.</li>
        <li><strong>"Nothing about us without us"</strong> extends to our elders.</li>
    </ul>
