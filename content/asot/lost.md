    <h2>What Triggers a Late Diagnosis?</h2>
    <p>Often, a life event drastically alters the person's capacity to cope:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Burnout:</strong> Decades of masking finally depletes energy reserves.</li>
        <li><strong>Hormonal Shifts:</strong> Perimenopause and menopause can intensify sensory/executive function struggles.</li>
        <li><strong>Major Transitions:</strong> Retirement, becoming an empty nester, or loss of a spouse removes stabilizing routines.</li>
        <li><strong>The "Genetic Mirror":</strong> Seeing their own traits while their child or grandchild is being assessed.</li>
    </ul>

    <div style="text-align: left; color: #333;">
        <p><strong>Background:</strong> Retired librarian. Always called "shy" and "rigid."</p>
        <p><strong>The Trigger:</strong> Husband passed away 2 years ago. The loss of his support (handling bills, driving, social buffer) caused a collapse.</p>
        <p><strong>The Misdiagnosis:</strong> Diagnosed with Treatment-Resistant Depression and Early Onset Dementia due to "confusion" (which was actually brain fog and burnout).</p>
        <p><strong>The Realization:</strong> Read a memoir by an autistic woman and recognized herself.</p>
