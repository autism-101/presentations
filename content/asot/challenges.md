    <h2>The "Double Whammy"</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center">Aging and Autism interact bidirectionally:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Aging processes (cognitive slowing, physical decline) can exacerbate autistic traits (sensory sensitivity, executive dysfunction).</li>
        <li>A lifetime of autistic stress (masking, sensory overload) may accelerate certain aging processes (health outcomes).</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="fragment"><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Reduced physiological and cognitive "bandwidth" to cope with stressors.</p>

        <h2>Healthcare Barriers</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Communication Mismatches:</strong> Difficulty describing pain accurately; doctors misinterpreting flat affect or direct communication as non-compliance.</li>
            <li><strong>Sensory Overload in Clinics:</strong> Bright lights, waiting rooms, and physical exams can lead to care avoidance.</li>
            <li><strong>Co-occurring Conditions:</strong> Higher rates of anxiety, depression, GI issues, and sleep disorders often complicate geriatric care.</li>

    <h2>Sensory and Cognitive Shifts</h2>
    <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p><strong>Sensory:</strong> Natural age-related hearing/vision loss *combined* with autistic sensory processing differences can be overwhelming and disorienting.</p>
        <p><strong>Executive Function:</strong> Aging impacts working memory and processing speed. For an autistic brain already working hard to organize, this can lead to significant functional decline quickly.</p>
        <p><strong>Burnout Recovery:</strong> Bouncing back from sensory or social overload takes significantly longer at 60 than at 30.</p>

        <h2>Shrinking Support Networks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Loss of "Buffers":</strong> Many older autistics relied heavily on parents or a spouse to navigate the social world. Losing them is catastrophic.</li>
            <li><strong>The "Group Home" Fear:</strong> Intense fear of losing independence and ending up in communal senior living, which is rarely sensory-friendly.</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Vulnerability:</strong> Due to lifetime underemployment (common in the lost generation), financial resources for aging may be scarce.</li>

        <h2>The "Autistic Advantage" in Aging</h2>
        <p style="text-align: left">It isn't all negative. Many older autistic adults possess unique resilience factors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Solitude as Strength:</strong> Often better equipped to handle alone time than neurotypical peers.</li>
            <li><strong>Passionate Interests:</strong> "Special Interests" provide deep engagement, cognitive protection, and joy in retirement.</li>
            <li><strong>Detail Orientation:</strong> Excellent at managing complex medication schedules or financial planning (if executive function permits).</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Conformity:</strong> Less pressure to keep up with societal expectations of "how to act" at 70.</li>
        </ul>
